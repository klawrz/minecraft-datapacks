This is an escape room puzzle inspired by Crimson Room from the early 2000's
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_room_video_game

THESE ARE TEMPORARY STEPS WHILE I FIGURE OUT HOW TO LOAD THIS UP AFTER NOT THINKING ABOUT IT FOR 7 MONTHS

To load the puzzle into your game, follow these steps:

- Add datapack
  - Select world > Edit > Open world folder > datapacks > Paste "klawrz-datapack" folder
    
- Add structure files
  - Select world > Edit > Open world folder > Paste "generated" folder
    
- Add scoreboard file
  - Select world > Edit > Open world folder > data > Paste "scoreboard.dat" file

TODO:

- Book to leave trial
- Set up a warp stand to warp into the trial
- Separate Mines of Moria map stuff from datapack file
- Update datapack to only contain escape room content
- Make a structure that contains the warp stand
- Set up structure origins (where to place crimson room)
