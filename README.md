This is an escape room puzzle inspired by "Crimson Room" from the early 2000s:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_room_video_game

THESE ARE TEMPORARY STEPS WHILE I FIGURE OUT HOW TO LOAD THIS UP AFTER NOT THINKING ABOUT IT FOR 7 MONTHS

To prepare your game to handle the puzzle, follow these steps:

- Add datapack
  - Select world > Edit > Open world folder > datapacks > Paste "klawrz-datapack" folder
    
- Add structure files
  - Select world > Edit > Open world folder > Paste "generated" folder
    
- Add scoreboard file
  - Select world > Edit > Open world folder > data > Paste "scoreboard.dat" file
 
To load the puzzle into your game, follow these steps:

- Determine where you want to place the puzzle
  - Place the crimson room origin structure
 
- Determine where you want the warp station to be for warping in and out of the trial
  - Place the warp zone origin structure

TODO:

- Amethyst Room is not complete in existing previous structures. Need to redefine the structure files, working backwards
- Separate Mines of Moria map stuff from datapack file
- Update datapack to only contain escape room content
- Make a structure that contains the warp stand
